# Data Analysis Pract

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lump1/DA_Pr_3.git
   cd DataAnalysis_college_datasets_python
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Script
Run the `main.py` file using:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting
- If `pip` is not recognized, ensure Python is properly installed and added to your system's PATH.
- If dependencies fail to install, try upgrading `pip`:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
